- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Giogify
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in nothing to concern yourself with.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently losing my mind.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: don't.

I like software development. I want to make a Terraria-style game, a RimWorld-style game, and a Lethal Company-style game, and develop my own programming language and OS like some Terry Davis stuff.
Please donate to me so I can spend 24 hours a day doing this passionate work: https://ko-fi.com/giogification
